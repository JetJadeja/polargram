# Polargram

Instagram like it's 1995.

Polargram is a unique, retro-styled social networking application that combines the functionality of Instagram with the charm of Polaroids. With this app, users can share their photos, which first appear as undeveloped Polaroid pictures. The images then develop slowly as users shake their phones, the equivalent to "liking" on this platform and a nod to the Polaroid tradition. The image only fully develops if enough users shake their phones, engaging the user community in the discovery of each shared image.

The app also takes personalization a notch up with a clever recommendation algorithm. It analyses the keywords of images you've interacted with, generating suggestions for posts with similar or matching keywords.

Built with Flutter and boasting a backend composed of Firebase Firestore cloud functions and a Python back-end for OpenCV image processing, Polargram brings nostalgia into the digital age with a distinct Windows 95 skin. Dive into a more interactive social networking experience, where the dopamine-fueled scrolling of yester-apps is replaced by a more engaged and satisfying interaction.

- **Uses your phone's accelerometer to allow you to physically shake your phone to develop an image!**
